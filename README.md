 Project Title

sNeAkkY CoNFesSIOns


**sNeAkkY CoNFesSIOns** is a full-stack web application designed for users to post and read anonymous confessions. The platform encourages open sharing without fear of judgment, offering features like emoji reactions, reporting inappropriate content, and an admin dashboard for moderation. The responsive design ensures a seamless experience across devices, and the modern UI is powered by Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
